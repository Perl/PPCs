# Multiple-alias syntax for foreach

## Preamble

    Status:  Implemented

## Abstract

Implement the currently illegal syntax `for my ($key, $value) (%hash) { ... }` to act as two-at-a-time iteration over hashes. This approach is not specific to hashes - it generalises to n-at-a-time over any list.

## Motivation

The `each` function is generally discouraged due to implementation details, but is still the most "pretty" and concise way to write such a loop:

    while (my ($key, $value) = each %hash) { ... }

An alternative to this would be a syntax to alias multiple items per iteration in a `for` loop.

    for my ($key, $value) (%hash) { ... }

This generalizes as a "bundler" - to alias a number of elements from the list equal to the number of variables specified. Such as:

    for my ($foo, $bar, $baz) (@array) {
        # $foo, $bar, and $baz are the next three elements of @array,
        # or undef if overflowed

## Rationale

The existing syntax to iterate over the keys and values of a hash:

    while (my ($key, $value) = each %hash) { ... }

suffers from several problems

* For correctness it assumes that the internal state of the hash being "clean" - to be robust one should reset the iterator first with `keys %hash;` in void context
* It's hard to teach to beginners - to understand what is going on here one needs to know
  - list assignment
  - empty lists are false; non-empty lists are true
  - that the hash holds an internal iterator
* You can't modify the hash inside the loop without confusing the iterator

You *can* write it in two lines as

    for my $k (keys %hash) {
        my $v = $hash{$h};
        ...
    }

(three if `%hash` is actually a complex expression you don't want to evaluate twice)

but that's not perceived as an obvious "win" over the one-liner.

The more general *n-at-a-time* iteration of an array problem doesn't have a simple generic solution. For example, you can **destructively** iterate an **array**:

    while (@list) {
        my ($x, $y, $z) = splice @list, 0, 3;
        ...
    }

(with that *3* needing to be written out explicitly - it can't derived from the number of lexicals)

You can iterate over an list non-destructively like this:

    my @temp = qw(Ace Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten Jack Queen King);
    for (my $i = 0; $i < @temp; $i += 3) {
        my ($foo, $bar, $baz) = @temp[$i .. $i + 2];
        print "$foo $bar $baz\n";
    }

but that

* is verbose
* is hard to get right
* repeats the three-ness in three places
* needs a temporary array (hence a copy) for a list
* also copies all the values into the lexicals

The proposed syntax solves all of these problems.

## Backwards Compatibility

The new syntax is a syntax error on existing Perls. It generates this error message

`Missing $ on loop variable at /home/nick/test/three-at-a-time.pl line 4.`

Existing static tooling should be able to recognise it as a syntax error, but without changes wouldn't be able to give any better diagnostics.

The proposed implementation has tests and patches for `B::Deparse` and `B::Concise`. `Devel::Cover`, `Devel::NYTProf` and `Perl::Critic` handle the new syntax just fine.

I don't think that we have any way to emulate this syntax for earlier Perls. I don't have any feel for what sort of API we would need to add to the parser to make it possible in the future, and whether any API we could add would be fragile and tightly coupled to the exact current implementation.

## Security Implications

We don't think that this change is likely to cause CVEs or similar problems.

## Examples

The examples in the *Motivation* seem sufficient.

## Future Scope

### Permit `undef` in the list of scalars

    for my ($a, undef, $c) (1 .. 9) { ... }

It's a reasonable generalisation of list assignment, where you can assign to undef to mean "ignore this value". It's also safe syntax to implement for `foreach` (either as part of this proposal, **or** at a later date), and likely will be useful in some specific cases. But **not** having it doesn't hinder the utility of the basic proposal.

The easiest implementation of *n-at-a-time* `foreach` is if there are exactly *n* scalars, all declared in the `for` loop itself, because this way they occupy adjacent Pad slots. This means that there is only one extra integer to store in the optree, which used both to calculate the *n*-at-a-time **and** the addresses of the target variables. adding `undef` to the mix rules out an obvious simple, clear implementation.

If we discover that there is a good way to add `undef` without much increased complexity, then we should consider doing this.

## Rejected Ideas

### Permit @array or %hash in the list of lexicals

    for my ($key, $value, %rest) (%hash) { ... }
    for my ($first, $second, @rest) (@array) {... }

Syntactically these all "work", and don't violate the assumption that all lexicals are in adjacent Pad slots. But it would add complexity to the runtime. Generalising *1 scalar at a time* to *n at a time* is mostly just adding a C `for` loop around some existing (known working) code.

Implementing these would mean adding code for what is basically a funky way of writing

    { my ($key, $value, %rest) = %hash; ... }
    { my ($first, $second, @rest) = @array; ... }

### Permit `our` as well as `my`

Using `our` instead of `my` works in the grammar. ie we can parse this:

    for our ($foo, $bar, $baz) (@array) {

However, the implementation would be far more complex. Each package variable
would need a pair of GV and RV2GV ops to set it up for aliasing in a lexical,
meaning that we'd need to create a list to feed into ENTERITER, and have it
process that list to set up Pads. This complexity isn't worth it.

### Alternative parsable syntaxes suggested by Father Chrysostomos

When this syntax was suggested in 2017, Father Chrysostomos observed that in addition to the first syntax, the next two are also currently errors and could be parsed:

    for my ($key, $value) (%hash) { ... }
    for my $key, my $value (%hash) { ... }
    for $foo, $bar (%hash) { ... }

He notes that it's only this illegal syntax that could not be parsed:

    for ($foo, $bar) (%hash) { ... } # syntax error

https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2017/04/msg243856.html

Strictly we also can't parse this:

    for (my $key, my $value) (%hash) { ... }

meaning that we can't offer choice of syntax in `for` analogous to:

    (my $foo, my $bar, my $baz) = @ARGV
    my ($foo, $bar, $baz) = @ARGV

which parse to the same optree.

However, these two lines are **not the same**:

    my $key, my $value = @pair;
    my ($key, $value) = @pair;

hence we should not offer the alternative syntax:

    for my $key, my $value (%hash) { ... }

For implementation reasons we only want to handle lexicals. This rules out:

    for $foo, $bar (%hash) { ... }

So these alternative possible syntaxes should not be offered.

### Should this be behind a feature guard?

As the new syntax was previously an error, and previously in similar situations we have not used a feature guard, we don't think that we should this time.
