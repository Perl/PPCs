## Abstract

Remove support for ' (apostrophe) as package namespace separator.

## Motivation

* Removal of ambiguous syntax that complicates parsing and confuses users.

From perldoc perlmod

The old package delimiter was a single quote, but double colon is now the preferred delimiter, in part because it's more readable to humans, and in part because it's more readable to emacs macros. It also makes C++ programmers feel like they know what's going on--as opposed to using the single quote as separator, which was there to make Ada programmers feel like they knew what was going on. Because the old-fashioned syntax is still supported for backwards compatibility, if you try to use a string like "This is $owner's house", you'll be accessing $owner::s; that is, the $s variable in package owner, which is probably not what you meant. Use braces to disambiguate, as in "This is ${owner}'s house".

## Rationale

* We have been warning against its usage for decades.
* It was there merely for easier adoption, but has been used very little.

## Specification

## Backwards Compatibility

## Open Issues

There are a few alternatives on how to disable this feature. Here are some alternative changes to the meaning of `'`

### String interpolation of identifiers:

1. Treat `'` as text — `"$isn't" == "${isn}'t"` 
1w. same with warning

2. Treat `'` as part of identifier — `"$isn't" == $isn't != $isn::t` and `"error: '$msg'" != "error: '${msg}'"`
2w. same with warning

3. Syntax error — existing code supports warning, could die instead, see `toke.c` and look for `tick_warn`

4. Current behaviour with warning

### Identifiers elsewhere (variables, function declarations etc.)

a. Treat `'` as part of identifier — `sub isn't { … } # would still work`.
b. Syntax error
c. Current behaviour with warning

All of the above may be turned on or off using compiler flags, pragmas or extending warning::syntax

The current patch that I made some years ago is mostly like: `1 + b`. This changes string interp

I think `2 + a` would be an interesting approach to keep backwards-compatibility somewhat. 

Both `1` and `2` changes interpolation behaviour, but we have been warning about it for some time

`1w`, `2w`, `3` and `4` requires to keep around `tick_warn` in toke.c

`c` requires adding new code to warn correctly and keeping around ident parsing code: 

```
$ perl -wlE 'sub foo'"'"'bar { "lol"; }; print foo::bar();'
lol
```

### Known core / dual-life modules utlizing apostrophe as separator

* autodie test in Klingon [trivial to replace]
* Term-Cap `isn't` in test [trivial to replace]
* PathTools `isn't` in test [trivial to replace]
* Test-Simple `isn::t` [would work wth 2 + b, or state compatibility in docs]
* Scalar-List-Utils `set_subname` implementation [need to check version in .xs code etc]
