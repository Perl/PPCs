## Abstract

This RFC proposes a `yield_true` feature. When used, the current Perl _file_
containing `use feature 'yield_true'l` will automatically return a true value
after successful compilation, eliminating the neeed for a "1" (or other true
value) at the end of the file.

## Motivation

Eliminate the need for a true value at the end of a Perl file.

## Rationale

There's no need to have a true value be hard-coded in our files that we
`use`. Further, newer programmers can get confused because sometimes code
_doesn't_ end with a true value but nonetheless compiles just fine because
_something_ in the code returned a true value and the code compiles as a
side-effect.


## Specification

    use feature 'yield_true';

Code using the above does not need to return a magic true value when compiled.

## Backwards Compatibility

There are no compatibility concerns I'm aware of.

## Security Implications

None expected.

## Examples

None. See above.

## Prototype Implementation

None.

## Future Scope

I believe this is complete.

## Rejected Ideas

None that I'm aware of.

## Open Issues

None that I'm aware of.
