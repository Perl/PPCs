# No Longer Require a True Value at the End of a Module

## Preamble

    Status:  Draft

## Abstract

This RFC proposes a feature which, when used, causes the current Perl file to
to yield a true value when C<require>d, eliminating the need for a "1" (or
other true value) at the end of the file.

## Motivation

Eliminate the need for a true value at the end of a Perl file.

## Rationale

There's no need to have a true value be hard-coded in our files that we
`use`. Further, newer programmers can get confused because sometimes code
_doesn't_ end with a true value but nonetheless compiles just fine because
_something_ in the code returned a true value and the code compiles as a
side-effect.

## Specification

    use feature 'module_true';

B<Note>: the feature name is not settled, C<yield_true>, C<module_true>, and
C<module_is_true> have all been suggested.

Code using the above does not need to end in a true value when required.

If the module explicitly returns a false value, module loading will fail as it
does now. If the module author wants the module to fail to load under certain
conditions, they should use C<die> or a similar mechanism with an appropriate
error message rather than returning false.

## Backwards Compatibility

There are no compatibility concerns I'm aware of because we're only suggesting
changing behaviour in the presence of a newly-added feature that is not
present in any existing code.

## Security Implications

None expected.

## Examples

None. See above.

## Prototype Implementation

There is a prototype implementation at [true](https://metacpan.org/pod/true).

## Future Scope

Due to this being a named feature, this can eventually be the default behavior
when `use v5.XX;` is used.

## Rejected Ideas

It's been discussed that we should return the package name instead. This
supports:

    my $obj = (require Some::Object::Class)->new;

However, per haarg:

> Changing the return value of require seems like a separate issue from what
> this RFC wants to address.
>
> If you wanted require to always return the same value, and for that value to
> come from the file, you need a new location to store these values. This
> would probably mean a new superglobal to go along with %INC. And it would
> usually be useless because most modules return 1. I don't think this is a
> very good idea.
>
> If you wanted require to always return the package name, it's a separate
> issue from this RFC because that means ignoring the return value from the
> file. It also presents a problem because require doesn't actually take
> package names.  It takes file path fragments. Foo::Bar is translated to
> "Foo/Bar.pm" at parse time. This would then need to be converted back to a
> package name, or do something else. I don't think this is a good idea
> either.
>
> Instead, it's probably best addressed with a builtin::load or similar
> routine that accepts a package as a string. This has been discussed in the
> past, and solves other problems. Module::Runtime has a use_module function
> that behaves like this, returning the package name.

Thus, we prefer simply returning `true` (or `1`).

## Open Issues

* Should returning a false value be ignored?
* Should any explicit return be an error?
