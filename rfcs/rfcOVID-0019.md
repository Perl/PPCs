## Abstract

This RFC proposes adding built-in lexical exporting via an `:export`
attribute.

## Motivation

To eliminate the need for the myriad different CPAN modules for exporting
functions. This RFC is only for functions, not variables.

## Rationale

There are many exporter modules available. The core `Exporter` is the best
known, and has the curious feature of allowing procedural modules to use
inheritance to implement exporting via package variables. It has a clumsy
interface and many alternatives arose:

* [Sub::Exporter](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sub::Exporter)
* [Exporter::Lite](https://metacpan.org/pod/Exporter::Lite)
* [Exporter::Easy](https://metacpan.org/pod/Exporter::Easy)
* [Exporter::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/Exporter::Tiny)

And more, including many modules which manually implement exporting directly
in the `import` method.

There are also many attribute-based exporters:

* [Exporter::Simple](https://metacpan.org/pod/Exporter::Simple)
* [Perl6::Export](https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl6::Export) (not really attributes)
* [Perl6::Export::Attrs](https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl6::Export::Attrs)
* [Exporter::Attributes](https://metacpan.org/pod/Exporter::Attributes)

And so on.

## Specification

### Usage

Because lower-case attribute names are reserved for Perl's future expansion,
we do not need a feature guard. Instead, we can simply `use v5.XX` to pull in
the new feature. However, even that might not be needed if they're using a
future Perl since it doesn't conflict with anything default.

```perl
package My::Module {
    use v5.38;

    sub bar  :export            {...} # @EXPORT_OK
    sub baz  :export(:strings)  {...} # %EXPORT_TAGS
    sub bay  :export(:strings)  {...} # %EXPORT_TAGS
    sub quux :export(:DEFAULT)  {...} # @EXPORT
    sub whee                    {...} # not exported
}
```

The above behaves similarly to:

```perl
package My::Module {
    use base 'Exporter';

    our @EXPORT    = qw(quux);
    our @EXPORT_OK = qw(
        bar
        baz
        bay
    )
    our %EXPORT_TAGS = qw(
        'all'     => \@EXPORT_OK,
        'strings' => qw(bay baz),
    );

    sub bar  {...}
    sub baz  {...}
    sub bay  {...}
    sub quux {...}
    sub whee {...}
}
```

The requested functions are imported lexically, rather than appearing in the
package symbol table. This means that code within that lexical scope can see
and call them as normal, but they are not visible from outside the scope to
which they are exported, such as from other callers or as object or class
methods. This removes the need for `namespace::clean` and related modules.

Upper-case `:export` attribute arguments are reserved for Perl to avoid
clashing with user-defined tags. This is because in this author's experience,
export tags are _usually_ lower-case.

### Interface

The various incantations of `:export` should populate the respective
`@EXPORT`, `@EXPORT_OK`, and `%EXPORT_TAGS` package variables to maintain a
consistent API with the `Exporter` module.

### Implementation

Per [an email from Ricardo
Signes](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2022/02/msg262791.html),
the basic lexical exporting functionality should be implemented via a core
module that we will call `lexport` (for the sake of argument). The interface
might look similar to this:

```perl
lexport->export(
    name1 => coderef1,
    name2 => coderef2,
    ...
);
```

That would export lexical functions into the current namespace.

This module will not allow unexporting lexical functions.

Only coderefs are supported (variables can be wrapped in coderefs). We may
revisit this decision in the future.

We might also wish to [implement `UNIVERSAL::import()` in `universal.c` to
deal with some historical
baggage](https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2022/02/msg262979.html).

## Backwards Compatibility

For basic usage without an `import` method, there are no
backwards-compatibility issues. There are, however a few surprises.

* Debugger

When using the debugger, it's common to test the return value of a subroutine:

```
auto(-1)  DB<2> v
30
31:    if (@errors) {
32:        warn join "\n" => @errors;
33==>    say status();
34     }
35
36:    unless ( $opt_for{description} ) {
37:        say "Please enter a description for this $opt_for{type} entry:";
38:        chomp( my $description = <STDIN> );
39:        $opt_for{description} = $description;
DB<2> x status()
Undefined subroutine &main::status called at ...
```

The subroutine is bound a compile-time and removed from the namespace. You can
step into it, but you can't call it directly from the debugger. This should be
considered.

* Exporting Spec

We often have the following near the top of our code:

```perl
our @EXPORT    = qw(quux);
our @EXPORT_OK = qw(
    bar
    baz
    bay
)
our %EXPORT_TAGS = qw(
    'all'     => \@EXPORT_OK,
    'strings' => qw(bay baz),
);
```

Note that there is a need to duplicate some function names.

Some developers like a single exporting spec at the top of a module. Others
like viewing a function and seeing directly if it can be exported:

```perl
sub foo :export () {
    ...
}
```

* The `import()` method

This one is tricky because we have to maintain backwards-compatibility.

If there is no `import()` method defined in the class (inheriting does not
count?), then any attempt to import a function not designated for export should
be a fatal error:

```
$ perl -MMy::Module=whee -E 1
"whee" is not exported by the My::Module module
Can't continue after import errors at -e line 0.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted.
```

For the following, we'll use the following stub example of an `import()`
method:

```perl
package My::Module {
    use v5.38;

    sub import ($class, @args) {
        ...
    }
    sub bar  :export            {...} # @EXPORT_OK
    sub baz  :export(:strings)  {...} # %EXPORT_TAGS
    sub bay  :export(:strings)  {...} # %EXPORT_TAGS
    sub quux :export(:DEFAULT)  {...} # @EXPORT
    sub whee                    {...} # not exported
}
```

If an `import()` method is defined, it's possible that it might have special
importing functionality provided, but we will _still_ allowing importing of
functions with `:export` tags. We pass the import arguments unchanged to the
`import()` method (in `@args`, above) and the module author will be
responsible for filtering those manually. This seems unfortunate, but if
someone uses `use v5XX`, their import mechanism shouldn't suddenly break.

As a counter-argument, it's unlikely someone will be using `:export`
attributes, so we could simply filter out all subnames so they don't populate
`@args`, or filter out all subnames tagged with `:export`.

For the above, that means that these are problematic:

```perl
use My::Module ':srtings';
use My::Module 'whee';
```

For `:srtings`, that's almost certainly misspelled. For `whee`, that's not
supposed to be exported, but perhaps the module author wants to allow that in
the argument list.

To side-step this, we could create an alternate to the `import()` method,
perhaps as something analogous to a phaser, but taking arguments, or a new
`IMPORT` method. Bike-shedding may now commence!

## Security Implications

None anticipated, but by having the imports being lexical, it means outside
code might have a harder time replacing these functions.

## Examples

```perl
package My::Module {
    use v5.38;

    sub bar  :export            {...} # @EXPORT_OK
    sub baz  :export(:strings)  {...} # %EXPORT_TAGS
    sub bay  :export(:strings)  {...} # %EXPORT_TAGS
    sub quux :export(:DEFAULT)  {...} # @EXPORT
    sub whee                    {...} # not exported
}

use My::Package 'bar';     # imports bar() and quux

use My::Package ':strings' # imports baz, bay, and quux

use My::Package;           # imports quux

use My::Package ();        # imports nothing

use My::Package qw/bar :strings -quux/; # don't import quux

use My::Module 'whee'; # fatal error
```

## Prototype Implementation

None that I'm aware of, though
[Perl6::Export::Attrs](https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl6::Export::Attrs) seems
the closest.

## Future Scope

We might want to allow variables and constants to be exported. We might always
want export tags to contain other export tags to allow "grouping" of groups.

The 'is not exported' error message could list what is actually exported by
the module.

An introspection API for procedural code (similar to a MOP), could be
provided. As part of this, it could provide an export spec. This could allow
Perl to start providing "smart" documentation that reads the code in addition
to POD.

We could also determine a syntax as importing as a different name. This should
be safe because they're lexical imports.

## Rejected Ideas

This was part of larger "AMORES" pre-RFC to improve the overall state of
procedural code. That pre-RFC was rejected, but I was asked to put this into
its own RFC.

## Open Issues

None?
